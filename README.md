## Description

Basic calculator that performs all calculations on the server and stores history on the DOM. 

Calculator can handle multiple operators and still follows order of operations. I wrote the code to do this myself, which I was quite proud of at the time as it was only my first week working with a server (node) and second week working with code other than very simple variables, conditionals, and functions.

Features:
- Executes simple math operations
- Works with multiple operators (i.e. 5 + 6 * 5 + 9)
- Follows order of operations
- Stores history of operations on DOM
- All calculations done on server
